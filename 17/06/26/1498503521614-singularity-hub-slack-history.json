For Singularity Hub we will stay building and storing on Google Cloud, and I'm interested to hear ways that people want to build (command line? still github pushes? command in CI like travis or circle? Docker Hub?) Any feedback appreciated. Otherwise I'll do what I think is best :slightly_smiling_face:",

If it's not defined, `latest` will be used. If there are conflicts (eg, two spec files without tags that would both be latest) a warning is issued and the more recently updated file is used.\n- the hub only maintains an image per tag specified by the user.
