I was pressed for time so I didn't think to save the output (I'd be happy to recreate it over the weekend). However, I remember that bug was fixed in the `librefractor` branch (which I'm assuming is now `development`). Cloning and doing a local build from the `development` branch worked without a hitch. I was wondering if it would be easy on your end to include the singularity branch in build options of Singularity Hub? Sorry if this is a repost/ not practical.",

To make it more flexible and error tolerant, I've added an optional environment variable that will completely disable color output. Eg:\n\n```SINGULARITY_COLORIZE=false\nexport SINGULARITY_COLORIZE\n```\nI also do a check to see if the output is not in a terminal (eg going to pipe) and it doesn't use color in those cases. I tried exporting the different TERM environment variables as you specified, but it didn't seem to cause issue with the colors. This could be that I am not able to reproduce a terminal that doesn't support ansi escape. From Googling, it seems like the biggest contender is Windows-based terminals, and we could do a check for the system type if we ever add Windows support. Which I hope is just never. I didn't say that :)",

For most of our bootstraps, a recursive function to change permissions on the tarballs is sufficient to produce a working container. This process is much faster than our old approach (by 2-6 or 7 times depending on the image), and the ideal \"default\" setting. However, we have niche use cases, namely containers like `docker://blacklabelops/centos` where the default doing this, <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/538#issuecomment-289534014|as we've seen before>\n\n```singularity shell docker://blacklabelops/centos\n```\nisn't going to work. However we should not add extreme levels of custom commands on funky tarballs that require slowing down the process by 2-7 fold for all users just for these niche use cases. \n\nThe workaround is to empower the user to ask for this permissions fix, and the slowdown, and we can do this by way of what I am calling a \"plugin\" or a custom function/filter to run given the preference for it. With our current base, this makes sense to specify via environment variables, and @gmkurtzer we could have some kind of command line flag, or in the case of many plugins, an additional `%plugins` or `%custom` section in the bootstrap (at some point in the future.) For example, here is how the current PR works:\n\n```\n\n*Runs normally, changing permissions after Python at the end  (fast)*\n\nsingularity shell docker://ubuntu\n\n*Changes permissions in memory using python*\n\nSINGULARITY_FIX_PERMS=True\nexport SINGULARITY_FIX_PERMS\nsingularity shell docker://ubuntu\n```\n\nTo see how it works, I've also prepared a <https://asciinema.org/a/118507?speed=3|DEMO>.\n\nIn the future, you could imagine something like:\n\n```\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: blacklabelops/centos\n\n%custom\nplugin fix_perms\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: blacklabelops/centos\n\n%plugins\nfix_perms var1\nadd_webserver port\n```\netc.etc.\n\n@singularityware-admin",

For example, docker inspect reveals the equivalent of it's configuration (and it's json, which isn't great for parsing in bash, but is still possible and of course works great with most programming languages). Here I can see it while running the docker container, ubuntu:\n\n```\n docker inspect ubuntu\n[\n    {\n        \"Id\": \"sha256:f7b3f317ec734a73deca91b34c2b1e3dd7454650da9c8ef3047d29a873865178\",\n        \"RepoTags\": [\n            \"ubuntu:latest\"\n        ],\n        \"RepoDigests\": [\n            \"ubuntu@sha256:f3a61450ae43896c4332bda5e78b453f4a93179045f20c8181043b26b5e79028\"\n        ],\n        \"Parent\": \"\",\n        \"Comment\": \"\",\n\n...\netc\n```\n\nRight now, just by running a command to cat the labels, I can see some basic stuff about a singularity container:\n\n``` singularity exec ubuntu.img cat /.singularity.d/labels.json\n{\n    \"SINGULARITY_DEFFILE_BOOTSTRAP\": \"docker\",\n    \"SINGULARITY_DEFFILE\": \"Singularity\",\n    \"SINGULARITY_DEFFILE_FROM\": \"ubuntu:latest\",\n    \"SINGULARITY_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION\": \"2.2.99\"\n}\n```\nso, given that we will eventually want to interact with containers in this manner (eg integration with external tools) and we want it to not have to be known that labels (or other stuffs) are \"hiding\" in this hidden folder, we should provide easy access to these things via some kind of `inspect`. We could even use singularity to bootstrap Docker's API and serve their metadata without needing to pull the layers (eg you could inspect a Docker image and return a specific field, the size, number of layers, etc., and this is useful so you know how to best generate your singularity spec that bootstraps a Docker image. Thoughts?",

                "text": "Hi @afortiorama,\n\nI am not sure that I understand exactly, but the administrator does have the ability to bind the directories that they wish. The admin can define the `bind point`s to always include into the container, and then can enable/disable the `mount tmp` option.\n\nBut we make an assumption.... That the admin defines the most a user can do, but it is up to the user to decide if they want less then that. For example, `--contain` is basically saying, \"I don't need what the admin suggested, I know what I'm doing, using at my own risk\". The ability for users to utilize the `-B` option is also enabled/disabled by the administrator. If the admin decides users can do that, then they can technically override the administrator's bind points and give themselves the ability to shoot themselves in the foot. LOL\n\nHopefully that answers your questions and concerns, otherwise please accept my preemptive apology for the misunderstand and never-mind. ;)\n\nThanks!\n\nGreg",

HAH\n\nIt came originally because I would always use `/bin/sh` for shell, but not all sh'es are equal (e.g. some are links to bash, sometimes dash, sometimes zsh, etc). It made the most sense to use Bash by default if present, but, when calling Bash directly, it automatically sources all of it's own login and dot files. Thus, if nothing else is passed, we call it with `--norc` option:\n\n```\n$ singularity shell -p /tmp/centos.img \nSingularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...\n\nSingularity centos.img:~/git/singularity&gt; ps auxf\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\ngmk          1  0.0  0.0  12884   156 pts/4    S    23:24   0:00 /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/action-suid\ngmk          2  0.0  0.3  15208  3120 pts/4    S    23:24   0:00 /bin/bash --norc\ngmk          3  0.0  0.3  50880  3240 pts/4    R+   23:24   0:00   `_` ps auxf\nSingularity centos.img:~/git/singularity&gt; \n```\n\nIf you specify `SINGULARITY_SHELL` in your environment, or use `exec` as you pointed out, you can bypass this default behavior.\n\nHope that helps!",

                "text": "hey @ityonemo ! I think this would be very reasonable / doable to implement, even without having the user specify a `%size` field.  Here are a few cases that come off the top of my head:\n\n*Case 1: User is making a new image*\n\nThis would be akin to doing a bootstrap or import into a newly created image. Given that we are adding docker layers to something, it is reasonable that, given that the layers dump is too big for the image that exists or is being generated, we could issue a warning. If we had create and bootstrap (or import) wrapped into one command (eg, @gmkurtzer this would have been like the docker pull I've been poking about) then the size of the image would be already available to compare against the size of the layers.  This would be fairly accurate given that the image is not yet generated, because we have confidence that most of the dump of content is going to fit in the empty image. So in summary:\n• given a new image with pull (bootstrap + create) we compare layers size to image size, stop if overflow\n• given a pre-existing empty image (bootstrap or import after create) we get size of image first, and compare to layers, stop if overflow\n\n*Case 2: User is importing into existing image*\n\nThis (I hope) is less likely done, because it would mean a less reproducible practice, but you can imagine importing layers into an already existing image. In this case, the most we can do is estimate the size of content in the image, estimate the size of the layers, and issue a warning (but probably not stop the process) if the imported stuffs is greater than the image size. The reason is because some of the dump of the layers might just override stuff already there, so the size wouldn't be extra added. So in summary:\n• given a pre-existing non empty image, we can't say what % of the image files will be overwritten, so the most we can do is give a warning.\n\n*Case 3: User is bootstrapping*\n\nThis case is most similar to what you are describing - the user has some idea about the size of the content in his bootstrap spec (meaning downloads and installs that aren't coming from the docker or other bootstrap). In this case, the user could specify some kind of `%size` parameter to check, but to play devil's advocate, couldn't he/she make this same specification when the image is created? Or is the idea to preserve this knowledge with the bootstrap?\n\nTLDR - I think this is a good feature to think about and possibly add, and implementation wise it is very doable. I added an endpoint to the Python internal API that will return the size for Docker layers, and this could be used by the calling function to do a check before any time intensive stuffs are done. I'll chat with @gmkurtzer about if/when/where would be reasonable to implement this!",

                "text": "I have encountered yet another problem on the way to simulate my robot. This time around it seems as if some of my system configuration has been copied into the container, overwriting the docker configuration.\n\nThe problem is that launching <http://gazebosim.org/|`gzserver`> inside a container results in an error being thrown:\n```Singularity dyret_map.img:~&gt; gzserver\nNo protocol specified\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'\n  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\nAborted (core dumped)\n```\n\nTracking this down lead to the discovery that inside the container the `locale` is set to the same thing as outside without installing the necessary languages.\n\nInside my container executing `locale`:\n```Singularity dyret_map.img:~&gt; locale\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=\nLC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_NUMERIC=nb_NO.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=nb_NO.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=nb_NO.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=nb_NO.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=nb_NO.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n```\nThen executing `locale -a` inside the container shows that the above languages (`nb_NO.UTF-8`) are not installed\n```Singularity dyret_map.img:~&gt; locale -a\nC\nC.UTF-8\nen_US.utf8\nPOSIX\n```\n\nIt seems to me that the configuration has been copied from my host computer into the container. To replicate this I created this small `C++` program:\n```cpp\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;locale&gt;\n\n// test_locale.cpp\n\nint main() {\n        auto loc = std::locale(\"nb_NO.UTF-8\");\n        std::cout.imbue(loc);\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello 'C' world!\\n\";\n}\n```\nWhich when compiled (`g++ -std=c++11 test_locale.cpp`) works on my host computer, but fails inside a Singularity container.\n\n```bash\nRunning post scriptlet\n• cd /workspace\n• g++ -lboost_date_time -std=c++11 test_locale.cpp\n     Running test scriptlet\n• cd /workspace\n• ./a.out\n     terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'\n     what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\n     Aborted (core dumped)\n     ERROR: Aborting with RETVAL=255\n     ```",

                "text": "ok, updates are the following! We wanted to be able to separate the downloading of layers from the changing of permissions, because right now they are packaged together, and each takes a substantial amount of time. However, you can imagine it would be less than ideal to do two \"batches\" like:\n\n1. Multiprocessing task 1: Download huge chunk of layers, since it's atomic, each is saved with some `.tmp` extension.\n2. Pass this list to Multiprocessing task 2: change permissions of layers, save with final name\n\nbecause let's say we have 15 files, it takes 10 minutes to get to number 10 and then for step 1, the entire thing dies. We have to start over. That's annoying, and that's why we have it (now) like:\n\n1. Download A, change permissions A --&gt; final A\n2. Download B, change permissions B --&gt; final B\n\nso the challenge is - how to split up changing permissions from downloading without making it a PITA if you fail mid way? I decided to do the following.\n\n*Dynamic Multiprocessing Client*\n\nWhat I basically wanted to do is allow for the multiprocessing client to, midway running things, add another \"thing\" to his queue, the \"thing\" being the file that is downloaded, but still needs permissions fixed. To support this, I made the MultiProcess client take an optional second function, `func2` and given that it's defined, it doubles the number of tasks to complete:\n\n```        # If two functions are run per task, double total jobs\n        if func2 is not None:\n            total = total * 2\n```\n\nthen, as before, we create a multiprocessing pool to start the first set of tasks to download the files.\n\n```            pool = multiprocessing.Pool(self.workers,init_worker)\n```        self.start()\n        for task in tasks:\n            result = pool.apply_async(multi_wrapper,\n                                      multi_package(func,[task]))\n            results.append(result)\n            level1.append(result._job)```\n```\nbut you'll notice I'm not appending these ids (`result._job` is an int) to a level1 list, and I do this so later I can check if a result object (one of the worker job things in the queue) has been processed through the second function. To do this, I then pop each result off the queue, and if it's a level1, and if a second function (eg change permissions) is defined, I dynamically add this new job to the multiprocessing pool:\n\n```            while len(results) &gt; 0:\n                result = results.pop()\n                result.wait()\n                bot.show_progress(progress,total,length=35,prefix=prefix)\n                progress+=1\n                prefix = \"[%s/%s]\" %(progress,total)\n```            # Pass the result through a second function?\n            if func2 is not None and result._job in level1:\n                result = pool.apply_async(multi_wrapper,\n                                          multi_package(func2,[(result.get(),)]))\n                results.append(result)\n            else:\n                finished.append(result.get())```\n``` \nThen we have some catches to make sure keyboard interrupts are caught, and we return the list of finished. To support this, the different functions for download and changing permissions are now under docker/tasks, and the `get_layer` function for the docker client doesn't change permissions by default.\n\nI think/hope this should speed things up a little bit! I haven't tested that all the results are still passing, but will update the PR with fixes for anything that doesn't.\n\n*Progress Bar*\n\nThe progress bar can now minimally show the number of total tasks (downloads and permissions) as separate things instead of them being bundled into 1. I've also fixed it so the shub downloads will have the progress bar again. I changed the `&gt;` symbol to a `|` because the arrow creates a sense of \"this thing is moving\" for the user, and it's more of a \"this is a marker for where we are\" now.",

                "text": "ok a quick update on testing this (trivially) with a larger image. It's expensive so I limited to the test to a subset of layers [0:12] for `poldracklab/mriqc`. I also ran it just once, so we are going to miss any and all variance. The serial test is as follows:\n\n```\n\n*('Serial download time:', 547.8233549594879)*\n\n```\nand the multiprocessing hung and never finished, and I wasn't able to get any kind of log, but I can talk about my observations.\n\nWhat I observed is that the multiprocessing handled the smaller layers simultaneously, and they were all completed very quickly. The bottle neck was the larger layers - because we are still handling the layer download and permission changes via one worker. This means that any improvements / speed ups in time are due to making the smaller layers efficient to finish in \"parallel\" but the bottle neck is always going to be the largest layer. Interestingly enough, dumping more stuff into one layer is the recommended Dockery way of doing things, to prevent having more smaller layers. It's even farther from our approach since we are working with entire image files. \n\nIt would be great if someone that has this kind of infrastructure could test this proper, or just give me a log in and I'll do it. I can't be charging my group dollars per hour for it, it's not really good.",

In the case of an empty layer, the total objects is 0, and you can imagine where that goes (division by zero, anyone?). As a reasonable fix to this, I have added a check for the number of objects, and given that it's 0, the user is warned:\n\n```singularity run docker://poldracklab/mriqc:0.9.3\nDocker image path: index.docker.io/poldracklab/mriqc:0.9.3\nCache folder set to /home/vanessa/.singularity/docker\n[1/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 3ed9\nWARNING /home/vanessa/.singularity/docker/sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4.tar.gz.IZWQ8d is empty.\n[2/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 4936\n[2/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer 4936\n[3/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer d712\n[3/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer d712\n[4/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 7366\n[4/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer 7366\n[5/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer de5b\n[5/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer de5b\n[6/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 4a55\n[6/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer 4a55\n[7/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 91f5\n[7/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer 91f5\n[8/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer f506\n[8/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer f506\n[9/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 12f2\n[9/24] Prepare  |===================================| 100.0% layer 12f2\n[10/24] Download |===================================| 100.0% layer 9ddc\n```\n\nI think this is a reasonable solution, because there could be many stupid cases when a layer is empty, and this should not break the standard import/run, but the user should be alerted in case this is undesired functionality. \n\nThis image is a beast so it's still running the above (we need to make sure there is no issue from within Singularity to still extract the empty layer, but after that we should be good to go. @chrisfilo \n\n@singularityware-admin",

Reproduce with \n```singularity shell --containall --home $HOME/root/home:/srv centos7.img\n```\nwhere $HOME/root/home contains some files you want in a temporary directory; it ends up with an empty directory instead of the one requested.  I believe the problem has to do with this message\n```singularity_runtime_mount_home()          Requested --contain option with no workdir, leaving homedir_source undefined\n```\nI attempted a quick fix (using SESSIONDIR if WORKDIR not found) but it still had problems so either I did it wrong or this isn't the last problem.",

This means we might expose it via an environment or config variable (likely config since the user could specify something suboptimal for the cluster) or have a calculation that figures it out automatically. The suggestions I saw were 2*CPU, but in testing on my small instance I found that generally odd numbers were better, eg 3,5,7.\n• Logging. I also figured out how to get the workers sending their logging to the log, and this can be done at the same level as the Singularity logger.",

A few things I'd like to talk about:\n\n*Progress Bar*\n\nthe stream downloader now has the progress bar removed, in favor of including it with the multiprocessing calls (to ensure that you don't see crazy output). This also means that the updates are less frequent, and a lot more jumpy (eg, one bar is shown for all layers, and it proceeds when a layer is done. I used Pool.imap instead of Pool.imap_unordered or Pool.apply_async to ensure that the ordering is preserved.  This also means that the progress bar is gone for shub, and this should be changed. I'd like to have a discussion about a new progress bar strategy - is there a more ideal visual that can be shown that doesn't have the arrow `&gt;` making the user expecting more moving progress? If so, should we do the same for the shub image, or implement the old version for that (having the call to bot.show_progress be in separate functions, which is different than how it was before, both were in the stream function.\n\n*Testing*\n\nI'd like to have some test this out on different OS and CPUs to see if it does make a difference. And also get feedback on tweaking the MultiProcess module that I added in case we can make it faster.\n\nI noticed strange behavior with pool, that it would print an empty newline after each process. As a fix I wrote a `mute` function that sends stderr output to null, and that resolved it. I don't think I need to close this, but wanted to check.\n\nGoing to sleep!\n\n@singularityware-admin",

So I got only about 1/2 done the implementation, but I tested this out:\n\n<http://www.vanessasaur.us/rawr/2017/multiprocess/>\n\nand it does look like there is marginal speed up for using multiprocessing. This was also tested on a dinky instance (read the post for details!) The challenge is going to be to integrate the progress bar into this framework. I have some ideas, but am still debugging a bit. What I'd like to do is implement a base working case, and then have it tested in a few different places (eg, more CPU!) to see how big of a difference it can make. If we decide to implement this:\n\n• we will need to be sure the progress bar is still useful, likely it won't have the same granularity\n• possibly we want to split the changing of permissions into two different things, so we can again have more processes working on it, and give the user better updates\n• I noticed cool behavior that I did optimally (on my weeny instance) with an odd number of pools. If it's the case that the number of pools needs to be optimzied per the cluster, we either need to:\n     • figure out the optimum at runtime\n     • give the admin a configuration value (with a reasonable default) and instructions / tool for determining an optimal\n\nor something like that. More on this later!! Learning about this stuff is wicked cool :)",

However, my case is somewhat different: \n\nMy app containers are ready and can be used on a single node.\nBut I want to invoke multinode `mpirun` jobs.\nThis is just doable from within containers because they use OpenMPI versions 1.xx (no hybrid MPI). Mpirun uses ssh to invoke the processes on neighbour nodes so I wrapped SSH to call from\n`ssh $HOSTNAME \"$MPIRUN_ARGS\"`\nto\n`ssh $HOSTNAME \"singularity exec $SINGULARITY_IMAGE $MPIRUN_ARGS\"`\n\nThis seems to work just fine until the point I want to pass a bind directory in the invoking call.\nI need the bind directories information to make it available to the neighbour nodes or else jobs die :(\nI didn't want to ask for making just the -B directories available as env vars because it is not too general. I reckoned it is better to have the entire cmdline. \n\n@gmkurtzer seems like there are a few possibilities to get the quotes into an envvar e.g. the `printq` approach: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6306386/how-can-i-escape-an-arbitrary-string-for-use-as-a-command-line-argument-in-bash>",

                "text": "hey @katakombi - this seems like a use case for some kind of workflow management that can handle the arguments and processing of commands, is that what you are getting at? The simplest way of going about this would be to have each container perform one small, modular task, and thus any running of it would envoke the task. custom arguments get tricky, but maybe you could do something like have the container expect inputs (and arguments?) to be specified in some log/folder where the call is from. Could you provide a concrete example for what you are wanting to do? I think a workflow management solution might be a way to go... for which <https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline|there are many!>",

For example, if the original command is something like:\n\n```$ test() { echo \"$*\"; }\n$ test yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"\nyum groupinstall Development Tools\n```\n\nYou can see how the quoting was lost in the response. So if I were to capture that in a single string variable that could be easily passed, I would also loose the quotes. For many commands this will work fine, but when things get quoted, unexpected results/failures will surface.\n\nThe appropriate way to deal with this is arrays, but that can't be easily obtained or passed via a Bourne environment variable.",

                "text": "Hello,\n\nAs with any job programs and data being run at scale, there is the possibility for congestion of shared infrastructure. Now, Singularity was architected for parallel execution in mind which is one reason why we use a single image file by default. This single image file contains the root file system of your container but the entire image does _NOT_ get moved from GPFS or any POSIX compatible shared storage to each compute node that is running it. But, there is of course some data that will always be pulled as the image is loaded. Initially the image and file system meta-data and header, then once it is loaded, only the bits required for the container to operate will be transferred. No wasted (or rather very little) wasted network Tx/Rx.\n\nAdditionally, for very large jobs, that require large amounts of metadata lookups, Singularity will also be very beneficial there as the image itself is only a single metadata lookup to your shared storage (GPFS, Lustre, NFS, etc..). Then the image's metadata is cached, and thus metadata calls on inodes within the image are all done locally, which can yield very high performance benefits when comparing to shared storage.\n\nTo summarize; yes, there will be an increase in network load due to the containers being loaded but the architecture itself was designed to be as optimal as possible to work with shared storage.\n\nLet me know if that answers your question and/or causes more.",

                "text": "hey @bkemish !\n\nWhen you bind the base of /srv, by way of project and share being in the image, they are included under that bind. However if /srv/home is bound first to home, it's going to skip /srv all together.

If users have their homes under srv, and the setting in the configure binds this automatically, this means by default /srv/home/username is probably bound to the container's home, and the rest goes away (as we saw above).\n\nSo the warning that you get:\n```If I try \"singularity shell --bind /srv my.img\" I get the warning\nWARNING: Not mounting requested bind point (already mounted in container): /srv\n ```\nIs related to that point.\n\nThe other two error messages are related to the fact that you are asking to bind directories that don't exist in the container. There is a setting in the config that will have something along the lines of \"create non existing directories by default\" and this is likely turned off. For example, when I ask singularity to bind to a non existing point in my container on my local machine:\n```\n:~$ singularity shell -B /srv/gitlab:/scratch docker://ubuntu\nDocker image path: index.docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest\nCache folder set to /home/vanessa/.singularity/docker\nImporting: base Singularity environment\nExploding layer: sha256:c62795f78da9ad31d9669cb4feb4e8fba995a299a0b2bd0f05b10fdc05b1f35e.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:d4fceeeb758e5103c39daf44c73404bf476ef6fd6b7a9a11e2260fcc1797c806.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:5c9125a401ae0cf5a5b4128633e7a4e84230d3eb4c541c661618a70e5d29aeff.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:0062f774e9942f61d13928855ab8111adc27def6f41bd6f7902c329ec836882b.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:6b33fd031facf4d7dd97afeea8a93260c2f15c3e795eeccd8969198a3d52678d.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:fe44851d529f465f9aa107b32351c8a0a722fc0619a2a7c22b058084fac068a4.tar.gz\nSingularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...\n\nSingularity ubuntu:~&gt; ls /scratch/\nconfig data logs\n```It works fine because /scratch was created on the fly!

The setting that controls that is the following:\n\n```\n\n*ENABLE OVERLAY: [BOOL]*\n\n*DEFAULT: yes*\n\n*Enabling this option will make it possible to specify bind paths to locations*\n\n*that do not currently exist within the container. Some limitations still exist*\n\n*when running in completely non-privileged mode. (note: this option is only*\n\n*supported on hosts that support overlay file systems).*\n\n*note: currently disabled because RHEL7 kernel crashes with it... :(*\n\nenable overlay = no\n```(note this is version 2.2 above) 2.3 now looks like this:\n```\n\n*ENABLE OVERLAY: [BOOL]*\n\n*DEFAULT: yes*\n\n*Enabling this option will make it possible to specify bind paths to locations*\n\n*that do not currently exist within the container. note: this only works when*\n\n*using the standard SUID mode (not user-namespaces)).*\n\nenable overlay = yes\n```\n\nSo given that you have control over the setup / config file and want to allow users to bind directories and have them automatically created, you can change this setting. If not, then in your bootstrap spec you could just make:\n```mkdir -p /srv/project\nmkdir -p /srv/share\n```\nand then I would specify home to be bound to /home instead, and just bind those two directories to themselves. Eg:\n```singularity -H /srv/home/vanessa:/home -B /srv/project:/srv/project -B /srv/share/srv/share container.img\n```\nI don't think you need to specify the host:mount if it's the same, I just like doing that so I'm clear about my intentions, to myself, lol.\n\nAn easier route would just be to bind /srv, given that it exists in the container, it should include the subdirectores. The reason I didn't suggest this first is because it might already be detected as mounted given that home is mounted by default in the settings. You could play around with doing this and mount home elsewhere, or prevent it from being mounted.\n\nHopefully this gives some insight and things to try! If you are still having trouble, please show the commands that you've tried with --debug and we should be able to see exactly what is going on there.",

We have started using Singularity at Vanderbilt University's HPC center (Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education, or ACCRE; <http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/>) and we LOVE it! Really great work with this tool.\n\nOne issue that is a little unclear to me...\n\nWe have a lot of relatively small, embarrassingly parallel type analyses on our cluster. It is not uncommon at all for users to submit and run 1000 or more single core jobs through SLURM at once with job arrays, with each job running for a relatively short amount of time. Should we be concerned about potential network congestion issues if an image is loaded off of a shared filesystem (we use GPFS) potentially hundreds or thousands of times in a relatively short period of time? Some of the images being developed by our users are on the order of 5GB. Does the entire image get moved from GPFS to a compute node each time a container of that image is run?\n\nThanks again, and all the best! ",

This is to fix a problem at least on some kernels (e.g. the one in Centos7.3), where there's something about singularity's use of containers that prevents the kernel from thinking that the image is still in use if this chdir is not done. That is, the kernel does not prevent the filesystem that the image is in from being unmounted.  This was first noticed in a case where the filesystem was automounted, but it is also easily demonstrated with a manual umount command.  Keeping a file descriptor open to the top level directory would probably work just as well, but this seems simpler.\n\n@singularityware-admin",

I also wish to bind 2 other network directories called /srv/proj and /srv/share. I created /srv/home, /srv/proj and /srv/share in the image. When I try to run \"singularity shell --bind /srv/proj --bind /srv/share my.img\" I get the warnings\nWARNING: Skipping user bind, non existant bind point (directory) in container: '/srv/proj'\nWARNING: Skipping user bind, non existant bind point (directory) in container: '/srv/share'\nand  the directories aren't bound.\n\nIf I try  \"singularity shell --bind /srv my.img\" I get the warning\nWARNING: Not mounting requested bind point (already  mounted in container): /srv\n\nIf I use a local user whose home directory is in /home everything works perfectly. I have tried changing the home using the -H option and --contain but /srv/home is still bound and I can not bind anything else in /srv. I can bind those directories to other locations on the image, but my use case is to run old pipelines which were developed on an old version of Ubuntu and unfortunately they have these directories hardcoded all over the place. Can anyone tell me how to either fix the binding on /srv or disable the automatic binding of $HOME so that I can bind /srv manually myself.\n\nThanks.",

However, once I'm done bootstrapping it, I should never need to make changes to it.\n\nIt would be nice to have a `singularity shrink` command, which will shrink a container image to its smallest size.\n\nIt's actually possible to do this in shell today, with something like this script:\n\n```image=PATH_TO_IMAGE\nstripped_img=`tempfile --directory=.`\ntail -n +2 $image &gt; $stripped_img\ne2fsck -f $stripped_img\nresize2fs -M $stripped_img\nshrunk_img=`tempfile --directory=.`\nhead -n 1 $image &gt; $shrunk_img\ncat $stripped_img &gt;&gt; $shrunk_img\nrm $stripped_img\nmv $shrunk_img $image\nchmod a+x $image\n```\n\nThe above shell is inefficient (space utilization is up to 2x the image size), but safe (the original image isn't deleted until the very end).\n\nBut, it would probably be better implemented in the same way as `singularity expand`.",

                "text": "Hi @kcgthb,\n\nYour point about library compatibility and portability between distros is a good one, but the Nvidia library does not and can not fix that. The libraries that the build (as I understand) are built against reasonably old and thus compatible versions of glibc, so we get general compatibility across most (if not all) current distributions of Linux.\n\n@GodloveD Can you test the latest development branch. I moved things to the C backend, and I've updated the frontend considerably, so now there is a dedicated action_argparser.sh which does the library discovery. Eventually, we can move that to C as well, but for the time being, this works fine and is easily compatible (as long as the libraries are found via ld's standard paths).\n\nThanks!",

I apologize if I am misunderstanding, but I think you might be conflating a few different ideas here.  \n\nIf you dynamically bind the NVIDIA libs into the container the way that @gmkurtzer is suggesting your are guaranteed to have an exact match between the binaries and libraries within the container and those on the host system.  The way I implemented it in may  gpu4singularity script you have to be finicky and match things precisely, but this will do it for you.   You will still have to install CUDA, cuDNN and anything else you need to run on top of the driver inside the container.  But that is always going to remain the case.  And CUDA is flexible.  You don't have to make sure your CUDA version matches the driver version precisely (there is no such thing).  You just have to make sure your driver is recent enough to support the CUDA you are trying to run.  I actually think this \"workaround\" might be a fully-fledged elegant solution once it's all coded up.  :smile_cat: ",

                "text": "@gmkurtzer: thanks for the details, very interesting, I didn't realize the security implications. Wasn't there a plan to move away from SUID and use a narrower set of privileges (with CAPABILITIES or something)?\n\nI'm wondering about the workaround you're proposing, though: doesn't this defeats the very purpose of containerization? I mean, if we expose and use host-level libs within the container, it will potentially be a source of conflicts and mismatches, don't you think? To me, the main goal of running an application in a container is to be able to abstract from the host's software and be self-sufficient in terms of libraries. Having a mix of host-level and container-level system libraries seems orthogonal to that.\n\nPlus, it will still require that the apps and libs within the container are compatible with the host libs. For GPU applications, it means that they need to be linked against a CUDA/NVML/driver version that precisely matches what's installed on the host. Which limits the portability of such containers. \n\nIn the end, the workaround may add some convenience, but I don't think it really solves the problem of portability. Instead of having to install in the container the precise CUDA/NVML versions that match the host's, users will be able to just use what's installed on the host, but their application will still have to match those libs.\n\nI believe that NVIDIA's solution were to introduce some level of library abstraction that is supposed to relax those lib version constraints, and allow containers and hosts to have somewhat different versions installed, so containers could be portable across a wider range of host settings.\n\nSo, I'm not saying the workaround is not interesting nor useful, but I hope it won't make the need for a more generic solution (one that could relax container/host versioning constraints) less important. :)",

Instead I am hoping to (with their help) implement the necessary features directly within Singularity proper.\n\n@GodloveD: Thanks! I will start working on moving it to C where I should be able to address your second point shortly.",

                "text": "After successfully creating a ROS Singularity container I'm having problem running ROS inside the container. Nodes in ROS speak over TCP connected through a <http://wiki.ros.org/Master|Master node> which orchestrates communication and it seems that this communication does not function properly inside a Singularity container.\n\nI have tested with two different images, both of which compiles fine, but neither is able to run ROS. The best traceback I have been able to produce is this:\n```Singularity test.img:/workspace&gt; roswtf\nLoaded plugin tf.tfwtf\nNo package or stack in context\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/roswtf\", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;\n    roswtf.roswtf_main()\n  File \"/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roswtf/__init__.py\", line 89, in roswtf_main\n    _roswtf_main()\n  File \"/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roswtf/__init__.py\", line 175, in _roswtf_main\n    roswtf.network.wtf_check(ctx)\n  File \"/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roswtf/network.py\", line 113, in wtf_check\n    error_rule(r, r[0](ctx), ctx)\n  File \"/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roswtf/network.py\", line 51, in ip_check\n    resolved_ips = [host[4][0] for host in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), 0, 0, 0, socket.SOL_TCP)]\nsocket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known\n```\nWhich comes from <http://wiki.ros.org/roswtf|`roswtf`>, but all ROS nodes exhibit this problem. When trying to run <http://wiki.ros.org/roscore|`roscore`> I get the following:\n```bash\nSingularity test.img:/workspace&gt; roscore -v\n... logging to /home/jorgehn/.ros/log/02ed15b6-240f-11e7-88b9-e4a471879cef/roslaunch-jorgehn-x1-carbon-28202.log\nChecking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.\nPress Ctrl-C to interrupt\nDone checking log file disk usage. Usage is &lt;1GB.\n\n... loading XML file [/opt/ros/kinetic/etc/ros/roscore.xml]\n... executing command param [rosversion roslaunch]\nAdded parameter [/rosversion]\n... executing command param [rosversion -d]\nAdded parameter [/rosdistro]\nAdded core node of type [rosout/rosout] in namespace [/]\nUnable to contact my own server at [<http://jorgehn-x1-carbon:42137/]>.\nThis usually means that the network is not configured properly.\n\nA common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check\nfor errors by running:\n```ping jorgehn-x1-carbon```\nFor more tips, please see\n```http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup```\nThe traceback for the exception was written to the log file\n```\n\nThe image I used to debug this is:\n```bash\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ros:kinetic\n\n%setup\n        # This is done before we are \"inside\" container\n```    # We first create our workspace folder\n    mkdir -p $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/workspace/src\n    # Then copy our code into this workspace\n    cd $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/workspace/src\n    git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git```\n%post\n        # This is executed inside container\n        . /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh\n        cd /workspace/src\n        catkin_init_workspace\n        # Then it is time to build everything\n        cd /workspace\n        catkin_make\n        catkin_make install\n\n%runscript\n        cd /workspace\n        source /workspace/devel/setup.bash\n```\n\nThe problem seem to be name resolution. I tried the following in Python inside the container:\n```Singularity test.img:/workspace&gt; python\nPython 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10) \n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; import socket\n&gt; &gt; &gt; socket.gethostname()\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 'jorgehn-x1-carbon'\n&gt; &gt; &gt; socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), 0, 0, 0, socket.SOL_TCP)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Traceback (most recent call last):\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known\n&gt; &gt; &gt; socket.getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', 0, 0, 0, socket.SOL_TCP)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [(2, 1, 6, '', ('127.0.0.1', 0))]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ```",

I would like to use singularity instead but as we update the drivers on the hosts quite frequently, the images will have different nvidia driver versions. I know that docker works well but what about singularity?\n\nThanks",

I looked at the diff and literally the only difference is the process ID and that the buggy path is `/om/scratch/Mon/satra/` and the working is `/dev/shm/satra/`. Probably @gmkurtzer will know this right away but I'll keep investigating anyway - what is the difference between those two filesystems?

Our variables are:\n\n• mount_final: which we see is `/var/lib/singularity/mnt/final`\n• overlay_options: (in this string) `Mounting overlay with options: lowerdir=/var/lib/singularity/mnt/source,upperdir=/var/lib/singularity/mnt/overlay/upper,workdir=/var/lib/singularity/mnt/overlay/work`\n\nCould you do `--debug` for the working case so we can compare how those two are different?

                "text": "In that case, the use of `%environment` will make `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` available via all Singularity action commands (e.g. `shell`, `run`, `exec`). If you put it only in the `%runscript` then it will only be available to the `run` command.\n\nAlso, I stress, that not all versions of `/bin/sh` (which is what gets called by the `%runscript` and everything else, will be linked to Bash. Thus defining the `export` on the same line of the variable may not always work. Standard Bourne syntax specifies/requires these being on two separate lines:\n\n```PYTHONNOUSERSITE=\"some-arbitrary-value\"\nexport PYTHONNOUSERSITE\n```\n\nSorry about being a nag about shell pedantics, but I've already seen this mistake bite others.\n\nHope that helps!",

                "text": "OK, I just want/need to reiterate... option 1 would end up discarding all environment variables unconditionally _except for_ ones that are necessary for appropriate functions (so far `TERM` and `LANG` have been identified). Then the question becomes, what do we set those to. The options that I see are:\n\n1. We set them static hard coded defaults via the C source code\n2. We set them via changeable defaults via `/etc/singularity/init` or a user's environment variables (my preference)\n3. We use what is currently defined in the user's shell (I was proposing only doing this when the `-t/--tty` option is used)\n\n@flx42 I don't want to have different environmental configurations for the different actions as `TERM` and `LANG` can be necessary for programs weather they are executed via `shell` or `exec` or `run`.\n\nFor bootstrapping (as @ArangoGutierrez eluded to), we end up setting `LANG=C` to ensure that builds function appropriately. I see no reason not to continue with that here. I think the right solution is setting `SINGULARITYENV_LANG=C` in `/etc/singularity/init` (which will transpose to `LANG=C` inside the containers even if `--cleanenv` et. al. are passed) and using the same `TERM` as always defined by the environment. `TERM` would probably be best set in the same manner as `LANG` in `/etc/singularity/init`).",

When `--cleanenv`, `--contain` or `--containall` is passed, discard all environment variables unconditionally.\n2. Assume some sane defaults, for example`TERM` and `LANG` both need to be defined to some reasonable setting for a lot of programs to work (perhaps `xterm-color` and `C` respectively?).\n3. Add a `-t/--tty` option that takes the current environment setting for `TERM` (if defined) and pass that into the container.\n\nIt is my vote, considering that `TERM` and `LANG` are generally considered required to always take one of not both of them from the users current environment on the host. I could see setting `LANG=C` as a general rule something smart to do, but where that happens is up for discussion. Another option is to make that part of `/etc/singularity/init`, such that the default behavior is easily modifiable, and that people can always override it in their own `~/.singularity-init` files.\n\nGreg",

I just did an ls for `/`, and then for `/dev` and then saw the only thing there was `null`. Then I searched for how to create the junk in `/dev` and found <http://serverfault.com/questions/91675/dev-random-is-missing-after-an-upgrade|this page> with the instruction to make those files. Then it just seemed to work? Reading that post, it sounds like `/udev` is used to dynamically populate that folder. I would look closely at <http://serverfault.com/a/91739|this post> and see if you can do the same, because according to it, not using udev has some kind of future consequences? Anyway this is an ok first fix, and I would give a shot at using udev. Give it a test and let me know!",

                "text": "Hey! Apologies for the delay - I had some unexpected badness happen yesterday that sent me through a spin, and I'm still catching up with stuffs.\n\nI just tested your build spec, and interestingly the first thing I noticed is that the commands work when you run them via shell (after) initially creating the image. This means that the bug is that something that happens after the `%post` scriptlet needs to be done before it. So first, to test this, I made the following spec file:\n\n```\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ros:kinetic-perception\n\n%setup\n        # This is done before we are \"inside\" container\n```    # We first create our workspace folder\n    mkdir -p $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/workspace/src\n    # Then copy our code into this workspace\n    cd $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/workspace/src\n    git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git```\n%post\n        # This is executed inside container\n        apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y vim\n        . /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh\n\n%runscript\n        . /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.sh\n        cd /workspace/src\n        catkin_init_workspace\n        cd /workspace\n        catkin_make\n        catkin_make install\n        /bin/bash /workspace/devel/setup.bash\n```\n\nmeaning that the compilation stuffs would happen at runtime, and we would have to use sudo with writable. So first create and bootstrap:\n\n```singularity create --size 4096 ros.img\nsudo singularity bootstrap ros.img ros.def\n```\nwhere\n\n```sudo singularity run --writable ros.img\n```\n\nand that actually works to at least get it compiled. But it's not ideal, because you have this extra step (that needs sudo) that really should be done with standard bootstrap.\n\nThe better approach would be to figure out what needs to be fixed to get it working in post. The first thing that happens is <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/development/libexec/bootstrap-scripts/deffile-sections.sh#L151|here> and the final chunk of stuff is <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/development/libexec/bootstrap-scripts/post.sh#L45|here>. It it's not something there, then it's something that happens with regard to mounting at runtime, and we could likely mimic that as well during post.\n\nI have to start making dinner, but I'll keep playing around with this later and likely tomorrow morning - just wanted to share with you some progress! I definitely think we will figure out this bug, or at least a workaround.",

                "text": "If this were any other variable, then to stay true to  `--containall` and `--cleanenv` we would not include `TERM`. But @flx42 original example with shell is an obvious case when this is pretty stupid to do. It would be highly annoying to have to add this as a custom variable to containers just to use these commands. Here are the use cases I see:\n\n*Case 1: User just wants to contain, or clean environment*\n\nProbably the user isn't going to think much about `TERM`, and it's going to be annoying and confusing to have the error message (as @flx42 showed above). This is one of those things that is just expect it to work, and users don't have a lot of preference for. \n\n*Case 2: User has preference for term*\n\nA user that *would* have preference would go out of his/her way to define the variable with the image. In this case, whether or not we define it wouldn't matter, the container's would take preference.\n\nThe first decision I'm thinking about is the above - should we include `TERM` at all? Based on what I said above, I think yes. The second question is, to what extent? So then we have a few options. \n\n• include `TERM` in a subset of commands for `--containenv`/`--containall`, meaning shell would work, maybe exec wouldn't. \n• include `TERM` in all commands for `--containenv`/`--containall`.\n\nThere is complete certainty of needing it for shell, and more uncertainty about the rest. But we do know there are edge cases when it would be needed, and then not defined. On the other hand, having it defined probably wouldn't hurt. It's also easier to do it consistently across commands than have a bunch of custom logic. So my final opinion is to include it, and include with all actions as one of those \"special singularity\" variables. If we find some use case that we didn't anticipate here where this is a bad idea, then we can step back and include under some conditions.",

One way to manage\n&gt; those software is by using module files. So I installed \"module_files\"\n&gt; package in singularity. But it is not working. Then I run the command \"yum\n&gt; info module_files\", it has the following errors:\n&gt; \n&gt; Singularity.container.img&gt; yum info module_files\n&gt; error: db5 error(28) from dbenv-&gt;open: No space left on device\n&gt; error: cannot open Packages index using db5 - No space left on device (28)\n&gt; error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm\n&gt; CRITICAL:yum.main:\n&gt; Error: rpmdb open failed\n&gt; \n&gt; Why did I have this error?

                "text": "Hi All,\n\nBased on my understanding, singularity can ensure the portability by compiling all software inside the container, so that when we move to another system we do not need to install them again. One way to manage those software is by using module files. So I installed \"module_files\" package in singularity. But it is not working. Then I run the command \"yum info module_files\", it has the following errors:\n\nSingularity.container.img&gt; yum info module_files\nerror: db5 error(28) from dbenv-&gt;open: No space left on device\nerror: cannot open Packages index using db5 - No space left on device (28)\nerror: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm\nCRITICAL:yum.main:\nError: rpmdb open failed\n\nWhy did I have this error? How should we use modules within singularity? Thanks.\n\nRegards,\nRengan",

                "text": "Hey @nordmoen ! I was just playing around with this, and I think it has something to do with the software using chroot and then <https://superuser.com/questions/165116/mount-dev-proc-sys-in-a-chroot-environment|not having those spaces mounted>. So fix 1, you could try mounting them. Another thing I noticed is that updating mkinitrd might fix the issue, but <https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/read_urandom-devurandom-open-failed-no-such-file-or-directory/|this is different on ubuntu>.\n\nYou probably want do compile from source, so you may not like this answer, but is there a reason to not bootstrap the ros docker image to start? Eg:\n\n```singularity create --size 4000 ros.img\nsingularity import ros.img docker://ros:latest\nsingularity shell ros.img\n```\n\nIt looks like the ros entrypoint is successfully passed to the runscript:\n\n```bash\nSingularity ros.img:/&gt; cat /.singularity.d/runscript\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec /ros_entrypoint.sh \"$@\"\n```\nand ros is under opt:\n\n```ls /opt/ros/kinetic\nbin etc  lib         setup.sh        setup.zsh\nenv.sh  include  setup.bash  _setup_util.py  share\n```\n\nNow if only I knew how to make a robot!\n\nGranted that the Docker images are maintained, you would be able to (literally) bootstrap that work for your singularity image, and not have to maintain updates yourself. If there are bugs with configuration, you could start with this as a bootstrap base, and tweak as needed, eg here is the bootstrap file\n\n```\nBootstrap:docker\nFrom: ros:latest\n\n%post\n\napt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install.... [etc]\n```\n\nthen\n\n```singularity create --size 4000 ros.img\nsudo singularity bootstrap ros.img Singularity\n```\n\nI just tested this now, (note using the development branch) and it seems to start up ok, although I'm not exactly sure how to make my robot. Anyway, how about give that a start, and go from there?",

                "text": "This enhances the yum bootstrap mechanism by allowing the author to specify a GPG key to be used by the initial run of `yum` (or `dnf`).\n\nThe bootstrap author uses the \"GPG\" field to place either a path or a URL to the GPG key.  The GPG key can either be specified as a path, or as a URL.  If an HTTPS URL is used, the bootstrap will check for curl (which RPM uses), and will fail if curl is not found.  If an HTTP URL is used, the bootstrap will fail unconditionally.  Only one key may be specified.\n\nThe field's value (after checking for HTTP URLs) is passed directly to `rpm --import`.  It is not placed in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg`; that is left to the appropriate `*-release` package (such as `centos-release`).\n\nChanges proposed in this pull request:\n\n• In the temporary yum config file, use `gpgcheck=1` (instead of `gpgcheck=0`) if the `GPG` field is set.\n• If the `GPG` field is set, and the field's value starts with `http://`, fail the bootstrap.\n• If the `GPG` field is set, and the field's value starts with `https://`, check if the `curl` command is installed.  If not, fail the bootstrap.\n• If the `GPG` field is set, and neither of the two prior conditions are met, run `rpm` to import a GPG key from [insert value of the `GPG` field here].\n\n@singularityware-admin",

                "text": "Updates to the PR:\n\n• the progress bar now lives with the SingularityMessage class, as this seemed the most appropriate place for it\n• untarring of layers from dockers changes all files (not symlinks) to o+rw and folders (not symlinks) to o+rwx. Just to make sure I did this ok:\n\n```    # Owner read, write (o+rw)\n    if file_permission == None:\n        file_permission = stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR\n```# Owner read, write execute (o+rwx)\nif folder_permission == None:\n    folder_permission = stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR | stat.S_IXUSR  ```\n```\n\n• The progress bar has been added to downloading files, with a default verbosity to print for info (and fixing permissions still only prints for verbose). I would suggest that we print one for both, however we would need to change the statement about fixing permissions to also be info. No, we can't combine them because they are two distinct loops/processes.\n• I estimate the size of the download from the Content-Length header of the response. and then add up chunks as I extract, updating the progress bar with the chunk sum / total content length. Given that the content length includes some extra (and it's hard to consistently estimate this) I made a small tweak to the progress bar to cap at 100%. This shouldn't be terribly misleading (thinks of Windows...) because in testing it never went over much more than 100.8 or 101.3ish. It's a trivial rounding that the user shouldn't notice, and it shouldn't mislead.",

                "text": "`0444` for files and `0555` for folders. This worked for .img images because the image itself had a set of permissions so even if everything was world readable inside the image you could still make the image file inaccessible to other users.\n\nI am not sure how this works with docker import. If at the end of the day you are producing a single .img file (or single squashfs file) this should not be a problem. However, if you are storing the imported image as a folder you could accidentally give read access to files that were suppose to be secret. This seems to be an edge case though because you in vast majority of the cases you will pull public images from docker hub. One could, however, imagine a case where you import an image from private secret docker registry and save it as directory of files with world readable permissions. This could be a problem. For such cases we would have to limit the permissions to the user performing the import (which unfortunately also makes the resulting container not usable by other users, so not really portable). We can also ignore this edge case for now (I don't really care about it since all of my code is public).",

Essentially, the following three variables are looked for, with preference for this order:\n\n• `SHUB_CONTAINERNAME`: will allow the user to define a custom name\n• `SHUB_NAMEBYCOMMIT`: if found, will name the container based on it's github commit\n• `SHUB_NAMEBYHASH`: if found, will name the container based on the hash of the file\n\nIt works as follows:\n\n```export SHUB_CONTAINERNAME=\"meatballs.img\"\nsingularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-images\n...\nDone. Container is at: ./meatballs.img\n```\n\nSecond preference goes to naming the container by commit. If this variable is found in the environment, regardless of the value, it will be done!\n\n```unset SHUB_CONTAINERNAME\nexport SHUB_NAMEBYCOMMIT=yesplease\nsingularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-images\nDone. Container is at: ./7a75cd7a32192e5d50f267982e0c30aff794076b.img\n```\n\nFinally, we can name the container based on the file hash.\n\n```unset SHUB_NAMEBYCOMMIT\nexport SHUB_NAMEBYHASH=yesplease\nsingularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-images\nDone. Container is at: ./a989bc72cb154d007aa47a5034978328.img\n```\n\nIf none of the above are selected, the default is to use the username and reponame (what we have now)\n\n```unset SHUB_NAMEBYHASH\nsingularity pull shub://vsoch/singularity-images\nDone. Container is at: ./vsoch-singularity-images-mongo.img\n```\n\n@singularityware-admin",

This path also works for us, but it's slower since you pay the extraction cost at every container start (and we have large images).\nNow the only option is to `docker export` to a folder, then `singularity shell ~/myrootfs/`",

I stopped putting conditionals in, so Singularity mostly works with user namespace on Ubuntu (as long as you don't use images), but not always on Debian. It is quite frustrating... Luckily, almost no big HPC centers use Debian or Ubuntu. I don't mean to alienate any of the *.deb-heads out there, but I did a check on the top500, your DGX was the only one!\n\nThe problem is that the user namespaces, even as Ubuntu implemented it, isn't quite enough for all of the HPC features most centers rely on. While, I would also prefer to discard the security baggage of SUID, it just isn't possible in the production world. :(\n\nYes, you are 100% correct about doing the import on a folder with SUID, and thus it is disabled.\n\nYou are also right about import \"should\" work without any security concern, but... import is an image specific function. Plus, I have an OCD about writing files to the file system that have incorrect permissions (and if splatting them out as a user, every file is wrong).",

You can use the Singularity Hub API to get these metrics, and embarrassingly I don't expose the build date, oups.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ncontainer = \"<https://singularity-hub.org/api/container/jokedurnez/HCPPipelines>\"\nresponse = requests.get(container)\n\nmanifest = response.json()\nversion = manifest['version'] # this is the commit\n\nimport demjson\nmetrics = demjson.decode(manifest['metrics'])\n\n*To get the latest version of a collection, across all tags (branches)*\n\ncontainer = \"<https://singularity-hub.org/api/container/jokedurnez/HCPPipelines:latest>\"\n\n*What we did above for the first call is equivalent to this*\n\ncontainer = \"<https://singularity-hub.org/api/container/jokedurnez/HCPPipelines:master>\"\n\n*Or you can get a custom tag like*\n\ncontainer = \"<https://singularity-hub.org/api/container/vsoch/singularity-images:mongo>\"\nresponse = requests.get(container)\n```\n\nFor future reference, singularity hub issues can go [here] (<https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/issues>)\n\nAnd I've added the request to add the date to the manifest above!

                "text": "In my mind, `.singularity.d` is like the pilot cabin of the airplane. It's important for the planes workings, the pilots communicate things back to the passengers, but the passengers don't get to go inside. I don't think I like the idea of encouraging the user to stick his/her hands in there, and that includes adding custom scripts. A con - this addition would still require having some command line or text file source to identify the scripts to add, and then adding a file to the tar, and then the result is (still) a container that has files that shouldn't be there. A pro - it gives the user more flexibility. But actually, maybe that's a con. We have a very basic need - adding or removing content from an (already existing) tarball, and the question is how to best make that happen.\n\nI agree with @gmkurtzer , now that I think of it, that we don't want to confuse bootstrap and import. Do you think it would be confusing to allow for an import also using an equivalent bootstrap file? Or should we have another interface? What we would basically be providing are tools for a user to edit a tarball. Arguably, given that the layers are local, the user could just do that him or herself. But that's kind of annoying. I (still) think we could have something that would look like:\n\n```singularity import image.img \n #or\nsingularity import image.img spec://Singularity \n```\n\nWhere `Singularity` is the definition file, even with extra sections like `%post` and `%setup` that are ignored given a non sudo import. So the C parser would do something like:\n\n• find runscript via the spec:// uri\n• check if From is docker. If not, stop and tell user can't do that\n• if docker, either parse %environment, %labels, %files sections and send to python with import, or send entire file to python for python to parse\n• %setup and %post are ignored\n• python parser does import, filters tarball, and writes metadata (labels, env) into same tarball\n• sends content file back to C, import finishes same as now.\n\nInstead of import with a spec:// uri, it also could be some custom flag like --filter file.txt that has simple commands like:\n\n```ADD /path/to/file.txt\nREMOVE /path/in/docker\nADD /bla/bla/*\n```\nand of course the challenge would be defining things like regular expressions. The rule would be that only the tarball content can be modified, and nothing on the actual filesystem or already in the container. I would even say we can make this more general, instead of `--filter` do something like `--edit` or `--modify` or `--usercommand` and then allow for a single text file with a list of possible COMMAND KEY VALUE pairs/trios that specify customization that can be done. For example:\n\n```REMOVE /path/to/folder/*.txt\nENV KEY VALUE\nLABEL Modified By Vanessa \n```\n\nand then the C parser could hand that whole thing to python, and python would parse it. It would look very similar to a Dockerfile, and be obviously different from the bootstrap file. ",

Import can not bootstrap, because on the backend it is just taking tar streams and throwing that into an image.

Bootstrapping is always the most flexible and easiest to customize, but that entire process requires root.\n\nI may have muddied the lines of what is possible by figuring out how to import as non-root, but the processes are massively different on the backend and generally not compatible with each other.\n\nNow going back to what @vsoch mentioned, we could modify the tarballs and/or tarstreams in flight. While that is possible, I don't know what that interface would look like, and because the backend mechanisms are not compatible between `import` and `bootstrap`, I don't want to do it via a definition file as that would confuse the process from the user's perspective.",

Instead, we would just have `%files` `%labels` and `%environment`, like\n\n```bash\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:latest\n\n%files[add]\n/local/file /path/in/container\n\n%files[remove]\n/path/in/container\n```\n\nWe would just need a way to distinguish the context of the files command. In the example above, I'm using the similar approach that pip does when you install a particular version of a package, eg:\n\npip install package[tag]\n\nWe could also take a Dockerish approach, and just have ADD and REMOVE\n\n```bash\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ubuntu:latest\n\n%files\nADD /local/file /path/in/container\nREMOVE /path/in/container\n```\n\nwhich might make sense so the user can specify an ordering, and it fits with our current schema. We would want a user to be able to use the same bootstrap file for (with sudo) which would include `%post` and without sudo, which would not. Cool request by @satra ! Thoughts?",

                "text": "Yeah I worked on this bug about 8 hours yesterday - I think this should fix it:\n\n<https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/568>\n\nThe reason it works the second time is because the download time is shortened, so the token to pull doesn't expire. The issue was a bit of a hairball - for larger downloads we have to stream the data to a file, but we also have to write that to a temporary file that gets renamed (for atomicity). When I added the fix for permissions to go through the first tar and change files with incorrect permissions, we needed another layer of atomicity to again make sure that if it died during that step, the final file on disk wasn't mistakingly used to be finished/correct. So first what was happening (that you are seeing above) is that the token would expire, the function would try to automatically refresh, it does this correctly, but then by way of being inside the function to do the stream, the header credentials wouldn't update. On the second go it would again fail and the catch statement (what you see above) is that it failed, and the message asks about write permission because in most cases (before adding the extra step) failures were due to permissions.\n\nOnce I fixed that, I started getting a new issue, that the tar file that was getting permissions fixed was empty. This was quasi correct - it turns out that it was only partially written, the reason again being when I'm trying to stream the file and it gets interrupted by trying to refresh the token, and it bugged out when it tried to pick up again. I also had implemented it in a way that would use the client's get function to retrieve a \"Unauthorized\" response and then use the Www-Authenticate field in that header to form the response for the new token. I changed that to cache the url on the first go, removing the need for another denied response, and that seemed to fix the inability to pick up the stream. As an extra buffer, I decided to proactively refresh the token before the download of each layer, so we don't reach this case, hopefully ever.\n\nSo yeah, should be fixed. And my soul is a little black and blue from working on that one, lol.",

I think symbolic links are sort of like metadata stored with these <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode|inode> things. So if you are creating a link between two files that are mounted on the host, it wouldn't be such a crazy idea that the inode of the host is storing the link, and the image mount is simply reading that. I bet you it's possible to keep this inode entry even when the mount goes away, although I'd need to read more about it. Did you check if the symlink persists on the host? ",

                "text": "Hi --\n\nWe're using Singularity in Penguin's POD cluster with Cent OS 7. We ran into a bizarre problem as described below.\n\nFor legacy reasons, we require the symlink  /home/myuser -&gt; /mnt to exist in our Singularity container.\n\nThe following works as expected:\n\n`singularity shell -B /path/to/data:/mnt myimage.img`\n`$ ln -s /mnt /home/myuser`\n\nIn other words, when I `ls /home/myuser`, I see the contents of /path/to/data indirectly via /mnt.\n\nThis works as expected; every time I bring up the Singularity image, I always create the symlink -- it will _not_ persist across Singularity restarts.\n\nTo run our jobs on the cluster, we wrap our job in a bootstrap script that first always creates the symlink as described above. Bizarrely enough, we notice that after we schedule these jobs to run and let them all finish, the symlink /home/myuser is now always available whenever we shell into our image.\n\nIn other words, the symlink now persists across singularity restarts.\n\nIt's actually okay for us if this is expected behavior, but I suspect it's not. Just want to understand what might be going on here?\n\nThanks!",

                "text": "heya @nordmoen ! I was able to reproduce your error - first I tried the above commands with Docker (it worked ok) and then via a Singularity bootstrap (with development branch) and I got the same error.\n\nI'm not totally sure about the cause - but methinks it has to do with some bug related to the package lists. Here is a hack I was able to do to get a working version:\n\n```bash\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: ros:kinetic\n\n%post\nmv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak\n\necho \"deb <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-proposed main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-backports main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-proposed main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src <http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> xenial-backports main restricted universe multiverse\" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list\n\napt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5523BAEEB01FA116\napt-get update\napt-get install --no-install-recommends -y\\\n   libgazebo7-dev \\\n    ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs \\\n    ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control\napt-get autoremove -y\napt-get clean\n```\n\nbasically, I reset the lists, add a missing key, and then do the same commands, and it seems to work.  I also compared the docker layers list to the order that we extract:\n\n```Exploding layer: sha256:fe56bbca99ef0d01cfd0a1cd244d502d2bc4a9ff1644c57f90430ef3dccfff2b.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:c4753b19db0ec26e7b3d18884d900e5827878528783ee5ac92d1695a4ccec137.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:ea91dbe33db172402ef57a520781bef17085c0f26a42a7b2066880b922c93583.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:e5003b0d605e2203c3e9ba8c867e714e20f8ae0eaba37475a09972699a884149.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:16bb9a4db6811f43eded43ebc997ba4e6927c971a977bbb862cec8da5e2336c8.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:93dc4092c5d90c1607a121e316eb47bd297ce7e777ea026dcd7839ed18b14adb.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:a0e02147b7fbec400f0f9749bbbe7062a4528576d55099323013ea9d97770a0e.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:13ddfb9aebdf97ec2fada9528c63adccc3dac5b78d475e96196462d9c3f8d988.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:6d9ef359eaaa311860550b478790123c4b22a2eaede8f8f46691b0b4433c08cf.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:9654c40e9079e3d5b271ec71f6d83f8ce80cfa6f09d9737fc6bfd4d2456fed3f.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:e8db7bf7c39fab6fec91b1b61e3914f21e60233c9823dd57c60bc360191aaf0d.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:f8b845f45a87dc7c095b15f3d9661e640ebc86f42cd8e8ab36674846472027f7.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:d54efb8db41d4ac23d29469940ec92da94c9a6c2d9e26ec060bebad1d1b0e48d.tar.gz\nExploding layer: sha256:f4fc4a53278bd2bb689e95f52c60b277eddc750457a2fa5e85b48983f9526964.tar.gz\n```\n\nand docker\n\n```Unable to find image 'ros:kinetic' locally\nkinetic: Pulling from library/ros\nd54efb8db41d: Already exists \nf8b845f45a87: Already exists \ne8db7bf7c39f: Already exists \n9654c40e9079: Already exists \n6d9ef359eaaa: Already exists \n13ddfb9aebdf: Already exists \na0e02147b7fb: Already exists \n93dc4092c5d9: Already exists \n16bb9a4db681: Already exists \ne5003b0d605e: Already exists \nea91dbe33db1: Already exists \nc4753b19db0e: Already exists \nfe56bbca99ef: Already exists \n```\n\nthe discrepancy of us having 14 \"layers\", and Docker only 13 is because the last is our metadata file:\n\n```sha256:f4fc4a53278bd2bb689e95f52c60b277eddc750457a2fa5e85b48983f9526964.tar.gz\n```\n\nso it might come down to this ordering issue again - I wonder if we goofed with regard to the order of extracting the layers?

                "text": "Hey @gmkurtzer ! Check out these changes. What I've done is updated the logger to be a class (`Logman`) instead of a variable imported from a file (which is a class, but one that doesn't have our own functions). It works similarity, except you import the logger class instead of the logger (now associated with the class):\n\n```python\n\n*Old way*\n\nfrom logman import logger\nlogger.debug(\"Oh no's!\")\n\n*New way*\n\nfrom logman import bot\nbot.logger.debug(\"Oh no's!\")\n```\n\nWhat this means is that I can add functions that made it easy to determine the level, and make it easy to understand the mapping between the Singularity C code and python. For example, to check if I should silent a (usually default) print statement, that is print exclusively for the user information and aesthetic, I can do:\n\n```if not bot.is_quiet():\n    print(\"The logger is not quiet.\")\n```\n\nI can also produce a data structure that gives information about the mappings:\n\n```python\nfrom logman import bot\n\nbot.is_quiet()\nFalse\n\nbot.get_mapping()\n\n{'ABRT': {'flags': ['--quiet', '-q'],\n  'python_effective_level': 50,\n  'python_level': 'logging.CRITICAL',\n  'singularity_levels': [-4]},\n 'DEFAULT': {'python_effective_level': 50,\n  'python_level': 'logging.FATAL',\n  'singularity_levels': [0]},\n 'ERROR': {'python_effective_level': 40,\n  'python_level': 'logging.ERROR',\n  'singularity_levels': [-3]},\n 'INFO': {'python_effective_level': 20,\n  'python_level': 'logging.INFO',\n  'singularity_levels': [1]},\n 'LOG': {'python_effective_level': 20,\n  'python_level': 'logging.INFO',\n  'singularity_levels': [1]},\n 'VERBOSE': {'python_effective_level': 10,\n  'python_level': 'logging.DEBUG',\n  'singularity_levels': [4]},\n 'VERBOSE1': {'python_effective_level': 10,\n  'python_level': 'logging.DEBUG',\n  'singularity_levels': [4]},\n 'VERBOSE2': {'python_effective_level': 10,\n  'python_level': 'logging.DEBUG',\n  'singularity_levels': [4]},\n 'VERBOSE3': {'python_effective_level': 10,\n  'python_level': 'logging.DEBUG',\n  'singularity_levels': [4]},\n 'WARNING': {'python_effective_level': 30,\n  'python_level': 'logging.WARNING',\n  'singularity_levels': [-2]}}\n```\n\nI think this is a good change because it will fix #544 and open up the door for future functionality for a user to spit a lot somewhere else, or even programatically post it to some more web based endpoint. Or do anything advanced with the logger, period. Let me know your thoughts.",

                "text": "&gt; --silent would JUST be for these print statements that, right now, are not associated with a logger level. Given an error, the logger would not be silenced.\nYou may already know this but I don't think I ever wrote it down... The rest of the code uses a messaging function that has a level indicator. The level indicator indicates how, when and where the message should be printed. This includes standard info based messages, logging, errors, debugging, etc. Problems (warnings and errors) are negative messages, and info are positive, increasing with debugging.The `SINGULARITY_MESSAGELEVEL` is what defines what level message should be printed (any level indicators equal or less then the messagelevel will be printed). So this means `--quiet` simply sets the `SINGULARITY_MESSAGELEVEL` to 0 (zero), when the default is 1, and 2-4 are different levels of verbosity with 5 entering debug.\n\n&gt; Github is great! Even @gmkurtzer is starting to like it, haha.\nLOL, yep! It is quite amazing how it changes the development paradigm from CVS/SVN.

To reproduce, can you grab the development branch build and install it, and then create a new container and see if it produces a mount on your ubuntu system? I think this should do it:\n\n```$ singularity create /tmp/test.img\n$ singularity import /tmp/test.img docker://centos\n$ singularity shell /tmp/test.img\n```\n\nThanks!",

                "text": "hey @gmkurtzer and @hra0031 please take a look! I removed the blind `chmod` and instead wrote a little modified check_tar_permissions function that will go through the members, and if it's a folder, file, or (not) symlink, check the permission and change to the one we want given it's not set, or below, eg:\n\n```def check_tar_permissions(tar_file,permission=None):\n    '''check_tar_permissions changes a permission if \n    any member in a tarfile file does not have it\n    :param file_path the path to the file\n    :param permission: the stat permission to use\n    '''\n    tar = tarfile.open(tar_file, \"r:gz\")\n```# Add all content objects to file\nfd, tmp_tar = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=(\"%s.tmp.\" % tar_file))\nos.close(fd)\nfixed_tar = tarfile.open(tmp_tar, \"w:gz\")\n\nif permission == None:\n    permission = stat.S_IWUSR\n\n# Check permissions for folders, not symlinks\nfor member in tar:  \n    if member.isdir() or member.isfile() and not member.issym():\n        if not has_permission(member,permission):\n            logger.debug(\"Fixing permission for %s\" %(member.name))\n            member.mode = permission | member.mode\n        extracted = tar.extractfile(member)        \n        fixed_tar.addfile(member, extracted)\n    else:    \n        fixed_tar.addfile(member)\n\nfixed_tar.close()\ntar.close()\n\n# Rename the fixed tar to be the old name\nos.rename(tmp_tar, tar_file)\nreturn tar_file        ```\n```\n\nThe \"fixed tar\" is originally a tmp file so we can be sure we don't write and replace until it's done being written. This should hopefully avoid the situation of an operation bugging out / being canceled, as the temporary fixed tar will not be found and assumed to be the finished real one. The one potential bug could come in if the user breaks an operation between the finish of a download, but before the permissions have been checked, here:\n\n```        targz = \"%s/%s.tar.gz\" %(cache_base,image_id)\n        if not os.path.exists(targz):\n            targz = client.get_layer(image_id=image_id,\n                                     download_folder=cache_base)\n            targz = check_tar_permissions(targz)\n        layers.append(targz)\n```\n\nIf the targz doesn't exist, then we are ok, it is downloaded and then checked. The issue would be that it gets downloaded, NOT checked, and then found and not checked. Ack, there could be some weird issues in here, let me see if I can fix this.",

It can't all be done in python because it needs to be done with a certain level of permission by the caller. But I think we can get this to work, because I think I can actually do the change of permissions to an in memory tar first in python, and then write and hand the fixed files equivalently to the calling function! This is actually sort of how we are doing the metadata folder.\n\nI'm going to bed soon and traveling a big chunk of tomorrow (yuckers!) but I'll be on this definitely by tomorrow and we will get the fix in soon.

So first make sure you have the right links to each in your git config:\n\n```cd singularity\nvim .git/config\n```\n\nIt should/might look something like this:\n\n```[core]\n        repositoryformatversion = 0\n        filemode = true\n        bare = false\n        logallrefupdates = true\n[remote \"upstream\"]\n        url = git@github.com:singularityware/singularity.git\n        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n[remote \"origin\"]\n        url = git@github.com:alanhoyle/singularity.git\n        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n[branch \"master\"]\n        remote = origin\n        merge = refs/heads/master\n```\nThen you can checkout a new branch called development. By default it will checkout a clone of the master, so you might want to start fresh unless you want the changes in this PR to persist.\n\n```git checkout -b development\n```\n\nThen you would want to pull the upstream development into it.\n\n```git pull upstream development\n```\nYou then will write the merge commit, and see a bunch of files added/deleted etc. You then will be on a development branch, with the development version! This is where you can start to make changes and stuff, and you can push to your forked development (origin):\n\n```\ngit commit -a\n\n*:i  message bla bla :w ESC :q*\n\ngit push origin development\n```\nand then when you PR, you would go from `alanhoyle/development` --&gt; `singularityware/development`\n\nGithub is great!

                "text": "haha, well what looks sort of similar / the same has different underlying things going on. Anything that doesn't require sudo is just obtaining layers and dumping them into the image, with their permissions as is. If you look in the <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/development/libexec/bootstrap-scripts|bootstraps scripts folder>, there is often a lot of functionality that goes beyond just dumping layers into an image, like stuff that happens on the host in setup, or things that would require sudo in any section, and I think the idea of bootstrap is to fit that use case. But I think you are right that we could have a subset / kind of bootstrap that doesn't require the extra bits (probably one using Docker and just defining environment vars and not much else), and basically fulfills the same kind of things as the current import (without sudo). \n\n I think our first idea is to wrap the above two commands into one \"pull\" which will create an image and dump layers into it, in one go. We will definitely think more about the \"non sudo\" bootstrap version, and how to best integrate it though.",

We must have a pull, lol.\n• added tests for size, each for docker and shub\n• adding a \"quiet\" command to several functions that might be called once during an import/pull etc, so the debug is not printed twice.\n\n@singularityware-admin",
